  <h2>Description about yourself</h2>
  <p>I am a hard worker and self motivated person.
    When I was in college we got permission to celebrate a fresher party.
    We are running short of time because of studies, hardly we have to prepare ourselves for Several events.
    I am worried about the party. At the time i motivated myself and started to think of making an event success. I take
    the initiative of this party and I choose my friends who are energetic for the event.
    I assigned different work to my friends , we organised some cultural events and games .
    Finally ,the event became a huge success and everyone appreciate us.

    I think I do concentrate on one thing at a time and that's why it becomes a bit difficult to handle other things at
    the same time for me.So I decided to do multitask also . Also some one asked me for help i can't say no to them and
    i end up doing more work.
    So want change that habit so I can complete my work first and then if I left some time I can utilizes it to help
    others.

  <h2>What is jam?</h2>
  <p>

    Just a minute or JAM topics in short is a round in some interviews where candidates are required to speak on a
    certain
    topic for duration of one minute.
    Sometimes the topic is given by the interviewer to the candidate and some other time candidate is asked to choose
    from
    a list of topics.

  <h1>How to write a resume in 10 steps</h1>
  <h2>1.Add your contact information</h2>
  <P>
    The first item on your resume should be your first and last name, a phone number and an email address. Consider
    also including additional contact information so potential employers have several ways to reach you. You may, for
    example, include your professional networking platform page or an online portfolio link. You can also include your
    address, whether it’s the full mailing address or just your city and state. Many companies prefer to hire local
    employees to reduce relocation time and expenses.

  </P>
</div>
<div class="content">
  <h2>2.Include a professional summmary></h2>
  <p>
    Since employers may only spend a short time reviewing your resume, you want to display your positive qualities
    clearly and concisely. These statements should illustrate the qualities that make you an attractive candidate
    while also describing the engaging yet professional personality you bring to work. Your summary statement should
    include a concise overview of your work experience. Try to focus on your experience as it relates to the role you
    are seeking to stand out to hiring managers. If you have less experience , you can provide a resume objective,
    which is a brief display of your skills and qualifications as they relate to the specific position you’re seeking.
    As with anything on your resume, these skills and qualities should be concrete and, where possible, quantifiable.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="content">
  <h2>3.Add your work experience</h2>
  <p>
    The work experience section of your resume should be more than a simple list of your previous positions. It should
    also effectively describe your work experience to enhance your candidacy. Some of the information you provide in
    this section is self-explanatory, such as job title, company location and dates employed. Where you can
    distinguish yourself in this section is with the descriptions of your previous positions. In each description,
    explain your previous responsibilities, noteworthy achievements and keywords that will make you appear the right
    fit for the job. List both your responsibilities and accomplishments and emphasize items that are relevant to the
    prospective employer. Rather than saying that you “worked on a team,” describe how you “coordinated with team
    members to develop over 30 software updates tailored to consumer needs.” Many companies use software to sort
    through large numbers of resumes and identify more promising applicants using keyword algorithms. You can
    supplement your resume with keywords in the job description. If a company is looking for someone who can develop
    products that guarantee a high return on investment (ROI), you could mention in a previous job summary that you
    “consistently increased ROI by guaranteeing high productivity on my team.” How much work experience you include
    will depend on your prospective position. If you are seeking your first job, for example, you may not have any
    previous professional experience to include, but you can include relevant internships or volunteer work. If you
    are a mid-level applicant, you may have a mixture of experience both related and unrelated to the open position.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="content">
  <h1>4.Include your education</h2>
    <p>
      Most jobs require at least some education, and employers seek this information on your resume. List your highest
      level of education completed first, then subsequent degrees and diplomas. You may also choose to include any
      active licenses or certifications. When entering a degree or diploma you are currently completing, add the date
      you began pursuing it and leave the end date blank. If you are in high school or just graduated, include this
      information. If you have completed a university degree, however, it is not necessary to include information
      about high school. In addition to listing degrees, include information about dean’s lists, honors recognition or
      academic awards. If you tailored your coursework to a certain specialty, you may include some of the coursework
      relevant to this prospective position. Typically, you don’t add your GPA unless an employer specifically
      requests it or you were top of your class.
    </p>

  Video: Where to Include Skills on a Resume
  <p>
    Sinead explains the best places to include skills on a resume including how to format a “Skills” or “Core
    Competencies” section. Near the end of your resume, you should include a section for any skills that may be
    relevant and can enhance your appeal as a candidate. When including your skills, choose both hard and soft
    skills that relate to the role. Soft skills may be abilities such as communication or leadership while hard
    skills could be computer programs or technical knowledge. To further enhance your image, you can add your
    aptitude to your description of a skill such as “proficient” or “intermediate.”
  </p>
</div>
<div class="content">
  <h2>6.Explain your achivements and awards</h2>
  <p>
    Employers may be more impressed if you can prove that your abilities have been tested and that you have found
    success despite challenges. You can emphasize your victories by including a brief section in your resume that
    outlines your relevant achievements and awards. Maybe you received “Employee of the Month” three times in your
    previous job or received an award for generating the most sales on your team in one quarter. These awards can
    set you apart from other candidates with similar experience.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="content">
  <h2>7.Use a business format</h2>
  <p>
    The format of your resume quickly tells an employer if you can follow directions and communicate effectively and
    concisely. In a way, your resume format is the first test of your experience before a potential employer even
    reviews your document. As with any writing genre, your resume’s format should reflect the expectations of your
    audience. For example, most employers will expect that your resume is one page. A professional resume format
    also generally includes a header with your name in a font larger than surrounding text and the rest of your
    contact information nearby. You should use an easy-to-read font, like Times New Roman, and space content so
    employers can clearly and quickly scan each section. Remember that when potential employers review your resume,
    they frequently scan through it quickly, which means you should make important information stand out. Consider
    using bold text for job positions and section headers.
